## Getting And Cleaning Data
###Course Project
  
The `run_analysis.R` script should be located inside the decompressed UCI HAR folder. This has to be the working directory.
  
The directory structure must be:  
  * .  
  * ..  
  * run_analysis.R  
  * /test  
  * /train  
  
The execution of the script `run_analysis.R` generates an output file called `output.txt`.  

The script uses two libraries which should have been loaded into the environment before execution. The script already does it for you.  
  
`library(dplyr)`  
`library(tidyr)` 

In order to run the script you can call `source("run_analysis.R")` from your R command line.

The source in the file `run_analysis.R` contains commentaries to help to understand how it works.
