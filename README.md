###Course Project
  
The to start with the decompressed UCI HAR folder in the working directory.
  
The data structure must be:  
.  
..  
run_analysis.R  
/test  
/train  
  
The execution of the script run_analysis.R generates an output file called: output.txt.  

The script uses two libraries which should have been loaded into the environment before execution. The script already does it for you.  
  
library(dplyr)  
library(tidyr)
